  heading: Who am I?
  text: >
    I'm a UX lead designer with extensive experience as a UX designer and
    researcher. I've worked on design teams in startups, enterprises, small
    teams, and large companies. I've been both a full-time employee, and
    contractor/freelancer.

    I'm no professional career coach, but I'd like to share my knowledge so that you can grow and elevate your career. Though I'm not an official hiring manager (yet), my input frequently influences hiring decisions, and I'm determined to increase Black representation in the UX hiring pipeline.
