title: UX career sessions
subtitle: 1:1 career sessions for Black UXers

intro:
  heading: 1:1 career sessions
  text: These free sessions are 60 minutes over video conferencing. I'm opening up timeslots on my personal time, when I am able to. **What I can offer** * Knowledge about job market, negotiation, your role, building your profile in the organization * UX leadership within your organization * In-house vs. consulting agency; small vs. large company * Up-leveling you in the early stages of your UX career * Being a safe sounding board to discuss difficult questions you're facing as it relates to race and gender * Transitioning from UX designer to researcher, and vice versa * Very lightweight portfolio reviews **What I can't offer (*I'm a busy one!*)** * Extensive sponsorship * Direct job referrals * Rewriting your resume *Please note*: I am not a career coach. I'm just here to provide my personal experiences and knowledge. My sessions will prioritize helping up-and-coming Black UXers gain access to knowledge and advice, given my own experiences as a WOC in the UX field. For folx who don't identify as such, you can sign up on my waitlist as I find more available timeslots. Please also consider looking into your local IXDA or [link](http://hexagonux.com/chapter-directory "Hexagon UX") chapter. I highly recommend Hexagon's mentorship programs, and I led the Seattle chapter for a few years. There are also many newly created resources for those who are affected by COVID-19 that area easily findable on the WWW: https://covidlayoffs.design/ https://www.researchersforhire.com/

blurb:
  heading: Who am I?
  text: >
    I'm a UX lead designer with extensive experience as a UX designer and
    researcher. I've worked on design teams in startups, enterprises, small
    teams, and large companies. I've been both a full-time employee, and
    contractor/freelancer.

    I'm no professional career coach, but I'd like to share my knowledge so that you can grow and elevate your career. Though I'm not an official hiring manager (yet), my input frequently influences hiring decisions, and I'm determined to increase Black representation in the UX hiring pipeline.
